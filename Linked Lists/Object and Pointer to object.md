## Difference between `node1.next` and `node->next`

* Difference between `node1.next` and `node->next` in the context of linked lists in C++. *

### `node1.next`
- `node1` is an object of the `ListNode` structure.
- You use the dot operator (`.`) to access the member variables and functions of the object.
- `node1.next` accesses the `next` pointer of the `node1` object.

Example:
```cpp
ListNode node1(1);   // Create a ListNode object with value 1
ListNode node2(2);   // Create another ListNode object with value 2

node1.next = &node2; // Set the next pointer of node1 to point to node2
```

### `node->next`
- `node` is a pointer to a `ListNode` structure.
- You use the arrow operator (`->`) to access the member variables and functions of the structure through the pointer.
- `node->next` accesses the `next` pointer of the `ListNode` that `node` points to.

Example:
```cpp
ListNode node1(1);   // Create a ListNode object with value 1
ListNode node2(2);   // Create another ListNode object with value 2

ListNode *node = &node1; // Create a pointer to node1

node->next = &node2;     // Set the next pointer of the node1 object (via the pointer) to point to node2
```

### Summary:
- Use `object.member` (e.g., `node1.next`) when you have an object.
- Use `pointer->member` (e.g., `node->next`) when you have a pointer to an object.

I hope this helps clarify the difference! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
